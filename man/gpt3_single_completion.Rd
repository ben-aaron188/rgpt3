\arguments{
\item{prompt_input}{character that contains the prompt to the GPT-3 request}

\item{model}{a character vector that indicates the
\href{https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3}{model} to use; one of
"text-davinci-003" (default), "text-davinci-002", "text-davinci-001",
"text-curie-001", "text-babbage-001" or "text-ada-001"}

\item{output_type}{character determining the output provided: "complete"
(default), "text" or "meta"}

\item{suffix}{character (default: NULL) (from the official API documentation:
\emph{The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text})}

\item{max_tokens}{numeric (default: 100) indicating the maximum number of
tokens that the completion request should return (from the official API
documentation: \emph{The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's
context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for
the newest models, which support 4096)})}

\item{temperature}{numeric (default: 0.9) specifying the sampling strategy of
the possible completions (from the official API documentation: \emph{What
sampling temperature to use. Higher values means the model will take more
risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (argmax sampling) for
ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or
top_p but not both.})}

\item{top_p}{numeric (default: 1) specifying sampling strategy as an
alternative to the temperature sampling (from the official API
documentation: \emph{An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus
sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p
probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10\%
probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or
temperature but not both.})}

\item{n}{numeric (default: 1) specifying the number of completions per request
(from the official API documentation: \emph{How many completions to generate for
each prompt. \strong{Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it
can quickly consume your token quota.} Use carefully and ensure that you
have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.})}

\item{logprobs}{numeric (default: NULL) (from the official API documentation:
\emph{Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well
the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list
of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the
sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.
The maximum value for logprobs is 5. If you need more than this, please go
to \url{https://help.openai.com/en/} and describe
your use case.})}

\item{stop}{character or character vector (default: NULL) that specifies after
which character value when the completion should end (from the official API
documentation: \emph{Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further
tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.})}

\item{presence_penalty}{numeric (default: 0) between -2.00  and +2.00 to
determine the penalisation of repetitiveness if a token already exists (from
the official API documentation: \emph{Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive
values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far,
increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.}). See also:
\url{https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details}}

\item{frequency_penalty}{numeric (default: 0) between -2.00  and +2.00 to
determine the penalisation of repetitiveness based on the frequency of a
token in the text already (from the official API documentation: \emph{Number
between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
repeat the same line verbatim.}). See also:
\url{https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/parameter-details}}

\item{best_of}{numeric (default: 1) that determines the space of possibilities
from which to select the completion with the highest probability (from the
official API documentation: \emph{Generates \code{best_of} completions server-side and
returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token)}).
See details.}
}
\value{
A list with two data tables (if \code{output_type} is the default
"complete"): \verb{[[1]]} contains the data table with the columns \code{n} (= the mo.
of \code{n} responses requested), \code{prompt} (= the prompt that was sent), and
\code{gpt3} (= the completion as returned from the GPT-3 model). \verb{[[2]]} contains
the meta information of the request, including the request id, the
parameters of the request and the token usage of the prompt
(\code{tok_usage_prompt}), the completion (\code{tok_usage_completion}) and the total
usage (\code{tok_usage_total}).

If \code{output_type} is "text", only the data table in slot \verb{[[1]]} is returned.

If \code{output_type} is "meta", only the data table in slot \verb{[[2]]} is returned.

\description{
\code{gpt3_single_completion()} sends a single \href{https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions}{completion request} to the Open
AI GPT-3 API.
}
\details{
For a general guide on the completion requests, see
\url{https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion}.
This function provides you with an R wrapper to send requests with the full
range of request parameters as detailed on
\url{https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions}
and reproduced below.

For the \code{best_of} parameter: When used with n, best_of controls the number
of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return â€“ best_of must
be greater than n. Note that this is handled by the wrapper automatically
if(best_of <= n){ best_of = n}.

Parameters not included/supported: - \code{logit_bias}:

\examples{
# First authenticate with your API key via `gpt3_authenticate('pathtokey')`

# Once authenticated:

## Simple request with defaults:
gpt3_single_completion(prompt_input = 'How old are you?')

## Instruct GPT-3 to write ten research ideas of max. 150 tokens with some controls:
gpt3_single_completion(prompt_input =
'Write a research idea about using text data to understand human behaviour:'
   , temperature = 0.8
   , n = 10
   , max_tokens = 150)

## For fully reproducible results, we need `temperature = 0`, e.g.:
gpt3_single_completion(prompt_input =
'Finish this sentence:/n There is no easier way to learn R than'
    , temperature = 0.0
    , max_tokens = 50)

## The same example with a different GPT-3 model:
gpt3_single_completion(prompt_input =
'Finish this sentence:/n There is no easier way to learn R than'
    , model = 'text-babbage-001'
    , temperature = 0.0
    , max_tokens = 50)
}
