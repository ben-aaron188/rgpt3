\title{Set up the authentication with your API key}
\usage{
gpt3_authenticate(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The file path to the API key}
}
\value{
A confirmation message
}
\description{
Access to GPT-3's functions requires an API key that you obtain
from \url{https://openai.com/api/}.
\code{gpt3_authenticate()} looks for your API key in a file that you provide the
path to and ensures you can connect to the models. \code{gpt3_endsession()}
overwrites your API key \emph{for this session} (it is recommended that you run
this when you are done). \code{check_apikey_form()} is a simple check if any
information has been provided at all.
}
\details{
The easiest way to store you API key is in a \code{.txt} file with \emph{only}
the API key in it (without quotation marks or other common string
indicators). \code{gpt3_authenticate()} reads the single file you point it to
and retrieves the content as authentication key for all requests.
}
\examples{

\dontrun{
# Starting a session:
gpt3_authenticate(path = './YOURPATH/access_key.txt')
# After you are finished:
gpt3_endsession()
}
