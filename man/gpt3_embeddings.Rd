\title{Retrieves text embeddings for character input from a vector from the GPT-3
API}
\usage{
gpt3_embeddings(input_var, id_var, param_model = "text-embedding-ada-002")
}
\arguments{
\item{input_var}{character vector that contains the texts for which you want
to obtain text embeddings from the GPT-3 model}

\item{id_var}{(optional) character vector that contains the user-defined ids
of the prompts. See details.}

\item{param_model}{a character vector that indicates the \href{https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models}{embedding model};
one of "text-embedding-ada-002" (default), "text-similarity-ada-001",
"text-similarity-curie-001", "text-similarity-babbage-001",
"text-similarity-davinci-001"}
}
\value{
A data.table with the embeddings as separate columns; one row
represents one input text. See details.
}
\description{
\code{gpt3_embeddings()} extends the single embeddings function
\code{gpt3_single_embedding()} to allow for the processing of a whole vector
}
\details{
The returned data.table contains the column \code{id} which indicates the
text id (or its generic alternative if not specified) and the columns
\code{dim_1} ... \verb{dim_\{max\}}, where \code{max} is the length of the text embeddings
vector that the different models (see below) return. For the default "Ada
2nd gen." model, these are 1536 dimensions (i.e., \code{dim_1}... \code{dim_1536}).

The function supports the text similarity embeddings for the \href{https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models}{five GPT-3 embeddings models} as
specified in the parameter list. It is strongly advised to use the second
generation model "text-embedding-ada-002". The main difference between the
five models is the size of the embedding representation as indicated by the
vector embedding size and the pricing. The newest model (default) is the
fastest, cheapest and highest quality one. - Ada 2nd generation
\code{text-embedding-ada-002} (1536 dimensions) - Ada (1024 dimensions) -
Babbage (2048 dimensions) - Curie (4096 dimensions) - Davinci (12288
dimensions)

Note that the dimension size (= vector length), speed and \href{https://openai.com/api/pricing/}{associated costs} differ considerably.

These vectors can be used for downstream tasks such as (vector) similarity
calculations.

\examples{
# First authenticate with your API key via `gpt3_authenticate('pathtokey')`

# Use example data:
## The data below were generated with the `gpt3_single_request()` function as follows:
##### DO NOT RUN #####
# travel_blog_data = gpt3_single_request(prompt_input = "Write a travel blog
# about a dog's journey through the UK:", temperature = 0.8, n = 10, max_tokens
# = 200)[[1]]
##### END DO NOT RUN #####

# You can load these data with:
data("travel_blog_data") # the dataset contains 10 completions for the above request

## Obtain text embeddings for the completion texts:
emb_travelblogs = gpt3_embeddings(input_var = travel_blog_data$gpt3)
dim(emb_travelblogs)
}
